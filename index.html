When you listen to the radio what songs do you hear usually? Pop right? Then what are those pop songs about? LOVE OF COURSE! Love song after love song AFTER LOVE SONG! It gets to a point where every song is the same. Iron maiden takes this formula and throws it out the window in order to deliver there 100% own ideas to the table. a song about being stuck in time, a song about a man having powers because he is the seventh son of a seventh son. A song about war, ace combat, Deep intlectual philosophy, talking about the way he treated a mans daughter and how the evil that men do lives on and on! some songs are just instrumentals and they are insane! Losfer words (big orra) is one good Instrumental along with Transylvania. To summerize, Iron Maiden brings a new medication to the pharmacy, a new dish to the table, Another Number of the beast. 


classic love song formula
<ol>
<li>Make it about love.</li>
<li>Make your song sad music about love.</li>
<li>auto tune your voice to sound like a robot angel </li>
<li>finish by making A ""Hot"" (vomit) music video</li>

One album will be about a guy trying to stop a satanic cult, the next will be about a guy stuck in mind prison, or real prison, its all to interprutation. Needless to say it's  all something different. even to this day they don't make love songs. Their newest album Book of Souls was about the creation and thriving of earth! Thats all to say really every album has a theme.
